\section{Symmetric Groups}

For a set $X$, a permutation of $X$ is a bijection from $X$ to $X$,
the set of all permutations of $X$ forms a group under composition
denoted by $\Sym(X)$. For $n$ in $\mb{N}$, we write $\Sym([n])$ as $S_n$.
Note that $|\Sym(X)| = |X|!$.

\begin{proof}
    We prove this by considering the number of bijections between sets
    $X$, $Y$ of size $n$. For $n = 1$, $f = \{(x, y) : x \in X, y \in Y\}$
    has only one pair. For $n > 1$: \begin{align*}
        m 
        &= \sum_{y \in Y} |\{\text{bijections from } X \text{ to } Y 
            : x \mapsto y\}| \\
        &= \sum_{y \in Y} |\{\text{bijections from } X \backslash \{x\} 
            \text{ to } Y \backslash \{y\}\}| \\
        &= \sum_{y \in Y} (n - 1)! \\
        &= n \cdot (n - 1)! \\
        &= n!,
    \end{align*} as required.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Cycles}

For $k$ in $\mb{N}$, a permutation $f$ in $S_n$ is called $k$-cycle if
there are $k$ distinct members $i_1, \ldots, i_k$ in $[n]$ such that:
\begin{align*}
    f(i_j) = \begin{cases}
        i_{j + 1} & j \in [k - 1] \\
        i_1 & j = k,
    \end{cases}
\end{align*} in which case, we write $f = (i_1, \ldots, i_k)$.
A $2$-cycle is called a transposition and cycles 
$(i_1, \ldots, i_k)$, $(j_1, \ldots, j_l)$
are disjoint if $\{i_1, \ldots, i_k\} \cap \{j_1, \ldots, j_l\} = \emptyset$.
Furthermore: \begin{itemize}
    \item A $k$-cycle has order $k$,
    \item $(i_1, \ldots, i_k) = (i_2, \ldots, i_k, i_1)$,
    \item $(i_1, \ldots, i_k)^{-1} = (i_k, \ldots,v i_1)$,
    \item $(i_1, \ldots, i_k) = (i_1, i_2)(i_2, i_3) \cdots (i_{k - 1}, i_k)$,
    \item Disjoint cycles commute.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Permutations as Disjoint Cycles}

For $n$ in $\mb{N}$, each element of $S_n$ can be written as a product of
disjoint cycles with lengths summing to $n$ which is unique up to reordering.
Every element can also be written as a product of transpositions.
\\[\baselineskip]
From this, we can see that $S_n$ is generated by the set of transpositions on
$1$, $\{(1, 2), (1, 3), \ldots, (1, n)\}$ as $(1, i)(1, j)(1, i) = (i, j)$.

\subsection{Cycle Type}

For $f$ in $S_n$ written as a product of disjoint cycles with lengths summing
to $n$, we take $l_1, \ldots, l_k$ be the lengths of these cycles in
descending order. The $k$-tuple $(l_1, \ldots, l_k)$ is the cycle type of $f$.
\\[\baselineskip]
From this, we can see that $|f| = \Lcm(l_1, \ldots, l_k)$.
