\section{Finitely Generated Abelian Groups}

We will write $\mb{Z}^n = \{(m_1, \ldots, m_n) : m_1, \ldots, m_n \in \mb{Z}\}$
and $e_i = (0, \ldots, 1, \ldots, 0) \in \mb{Z}^n$ with $1$ in the 
$i^{\text{th}}$ entry. These are the standard generators for $\mb{Z}^n$.
\\[\baselineskip]
For some $n$ in $\mb{N}$, we write $\mb{Z}_n$ to be the integers
modulo $n$ which is a group under addition. Additionally, $n\mb{Z}$
is a subgroup of $\mb{Z}$ and $\mb{Z}_n \cong \mb{Z}/n\mb{Z}$.

\subsection{Classification of Cyclic Groups}

For a cyclic group $G$, if $|G| = n$ finite, we have that $G \cong \mb{Z}_n$.
Otherwise, $G \cong \mb{Z}$.

\begin{proof}
    We choose $x$ as a generator of $G$. We take $\varphi : \mb{Z} \to G$
    to be defined as $\varphi(m) = x^m$. We can see that $\varphi$ is a
    surjective homomorphism. If $|x| = \infty$ then $\Ker(\varphi) = \{0\}$,
    otherwise, $\Ker(\varphi) = |x|\mb{Z}$. By the homomorphism theorem:
    \begin{align*}
        G = \Ima(\varphi) \cong \mb{Z}/\Ker(\varphi).
    \end{align*} The result follows as $\mb{Z}/\Ker(\varphi) = \mb{Z}$
    if $|x| = \infty$ and $\mb{Z}_{|x|}$ otherwise.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Torsion Subgroup}

For an abelian group $G$ with $T \subseteq G$ the set of
elements in $G$ of finite order and a prime $p$ with
$G_p \subseteq T$ the set of elements in $T$ of with order
equal to a power of $p$. We have that $G_p \leq T \leq G$
and $G/T$ is torsion-free
with $T$ called the torsion subgroup of $G$ and $G_p$ called
the $p$-primary component of $G$.

\begin{proof}
    We suppose $x$ and $y$ are in $T$ with $|x| = k$, $|y| = m$.
    We know that \linebreak $km(x - y) = 0$ so $|x - y| \leq km < \infty$,
    thus $(x - y)$ is in $T$ so $T$ is a subgroup of $G$ by the subgroup test. 
    \\[\baselineskip]
    Furthermore,
    $|x - y|$ must divide $km$ so if $x$ and $y$ are in $G_p$
    then $km$ is a power of $p$. Thus, $|x - y|$ is a
    power of $p$ so $(x - y)$ is in $G_p$. Again, by the subgroup test,
    $G_p$ is a subgroup of $T$.
    \\[\baselineskip]
    Suppose $z + T$ has finite order for some $z$ in $G$. If so,
    there exists some $m$ in $\mb{N}$ with $mx + T = T$, in particular 
    $mx$ is in $T$. By the definition of $T$, there exists some $n$
    in $\mb{N}$ with $nmx = 0$. But, this would mean $x$ has finite order
    so $x$ is in $T$. Thus, $G / T$ is torsion-free.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Primary Decomposition Theorem}

For a finite abelian group $G$, we take $p_1, \ldots, p_k$ to be the
prime factors of $|G|$. We have that $G = G_{p_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus
G_{p_k}$.

\begin{proof}
    We take $x$ in $G$, by Lagrange's Theorem, we have that
    $x = p_1^{l_1} \cdots p_k^{l_k}$ for some $l_1, \ldots, l_k$ in $\mb{N}_0$.
    For each $i$ in $[k]$, we set: \begin{align*}
        n_i = \prod_{j \in [k]\backslash\{i\}} p_j^{l_j},
    \end{align*} and note that $|n_ix| = p_i^{l_i}$ so $n_ix$ is in $G_{p_i}$.
    Clearly $\gcd(n_1, \ldots, n_k) = 1$, so by the Euclidean algorithm there
    exists $m_1, \ldots, m_k$ such that $m_1n_1 + \cdots + m_kn_k = 1$. Thus:
    \begin{align*}
        x 
        &= \left(\sum_{i = 1}^k m_in_i\right) \cdot x \\
        &= \sum_{i = 1}^k m_i(n_ix) \\
        &\in \sum_{i = 1}^k G_{p_i}. 
    \end{align*} Thus, $G = G_{p_1} + \cdots + G_{p_k}$.
    \\[\baselineskip]
    We now consider $x_i$, $x_i'$ in $G_{p_i}$ for each $i$ in $[k]$ such
    that $\sum_{i \in [k]} x_i = \sum_{i \in [k]} x_i'$. We write
    $y_i = x_i - x_i'$ so that $\sum_{i \in [k]} y_i = 0$. Furthermore,
    we say $|y_i| = p_i^{d_i}$ and set: \begin{align*}
        r_i 
        = \prod_{j \in [k] \backslash \{i\}} |y_i|
        = \prod_{j \in [k] \backslash \{i\}} p_j^{d_j}.
    \end{align*} As $|y_i|$ divides $|r_j|$ for all 
    $j \in [k] \backslash \{i\}$, we know that $r_iy_j = 0$.
    This implies that $r_iy_i = 0$ as $\sum_{i = 1}^k y_i = 0$.
    \\[\baselineskip]
    Moreover, as $r_i$ and $p_i$ are coprime by definition, the
    Euclidean algorithm implies that there exists $a$, $b$ in $\mb{Z}$
    such that: \begin{align*}
        &ar_i + bp_i^{d_i} = 1, \\
        \Longrightarrow \qquad & y_i = (ar_i + bp_i^{d_i})y_i,  \\
        \Longrightarrow \qquad & y_i = ar_iy_i + bp_i^{d_i}y_i,  \\
        \Longrightarrow \qquad & y_i = 0 + 0 = 0, 
    \end{align*} so $x_i = x_i'$ for each $i$ in $[k]$. Thus, our
    compositions are unique as required.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Finitely Generated Abelian Torsion Groups}

A finitely generated torsion group is finite.

\begin{proof}
    We take $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ to be the finite generating set for
    an abelian torsion group $G$ so: \begin{align*}
        G = \{l_1x_1 + \cdots + l_nx_n : 0 \leq l_i < |x_i|\},
    \end{align*} which is finite since $|x_i| < \infty$ for all $i$ in $[n]$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Order of Elements in $p$-groups}

For a prime $p$ and a $p$-group $G$, we take $g$ in $G$. We set $k$
in $\mb{N}$ to $np^r$ with $n$, $p$ coprime and $r$ in $\mb{N}_0$.
If $p^r \leq |g|$ then $|g^k| = \frac{|g|}{p^r}$.

\begin{proof}
    We know that $|g| = p^m$ for some $m$ as $G$ is a $p$-group.
    For $d$ in $\mb{N}$: \begin{align*}
        & (g^k)^d = e \\
        \Longleftrightarrow \qquad& g^{dnp^r} = e \\
        \Longleftrightarrow \qquad& p^m \text{ divides } dnp^r \\
        \Longleftrightarrow \qquad& p^m \text{ divides } dp^r \\
        \Longleftrightarrow \qquad& p^{m - r} \text{ divides } d,
    \end{align*} thus, $|g^k| = p^{m - r} = \frac{|g|}{p^r}$ as required.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Elements with Coset Order}

For $G$ a finite abelian $p$-group for some prime $p$. We take $g$ in $G$
to have maximum order. For every $x$ in $G$, there exists $y$ in $x + \ang{g}$
sich that the order of $y$ in $G$ is equal to the order of $x + \ang{g}$ in
$G / \ang{g}$.

\begin{proof}
    We write $x + \ang{g} = p^m$ for some $m$, noting that $p^m \cdot x$ 
    is in $\ang{g}$ so $p^m \cdot x = l \cdot g$ for some $l$ in $\mb{N}_0$ 
    (if $l = 0$ we are done). We write $l = np^r$ with $n$, $p$ coprime.
    If $p^r \geq |g|$ then $l \cdot g = 0$ and $|x| = p^m$ and we are done.
    Otherwise, we use the result above to see that 
    $|l \cdot g| = \frac{|g|}{p^r}$ and $|p^mx| = \frac{|x|}{p^m}$
    so $\frac{|g|}{p^r} = \frac{|x|}{p^m}$. The maximality of $g$ 
    implies that $|g| \geq |x|$ so $r \geq m$ and thus $p^m$ divides $l$.
    We define: \begin{align*}
        y = x - \frac{l}{p^m} \cdot g,
    \end{align*} thus $p^my=p^m(x - np^{r-m}g) = 0$ so $|y| \leq p^m$.
    But, as $y$ is in $x + \ang{g}$, $|y| \geq p^m$ so $|y| = p^m$ as
    required.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Decomposition of Finite Abelian $p$-groups}

For a finite abelian $p$-group $G$ with $p$ prime, there exists a $k$
in $\mb{N}_0$ and $m_1, \ldots, m_k$ in $\mb{N}$ such that 
$G \cong \mb{Z}_{p^{m_1}} \oplus \cdots \oplus \mb{Z}_{p^{m_k}}$.

\begin{proof}
    It is sufficient to show that for $x_1, \ldots, x_k$ in $G$, $G$
    is an inner direct sum: \begin{align*}
        G = \ang{x_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus \ang{x_k} \tag{$\ast$}.
    \end{align*} If $G = \{0\}$ then this is trivial so we assume $|G| > 1$.
    By strong induction, we assume every group of order lesser to that of
    $G$ is of the form shown in ($\ast$).
    \\[\baselineskip]
    We take $g$ in $G$ to have maximum order, $g \neq e$ as our group is
    non-trivial so $|G / \ang{g}| < |G|$ so by induction, there exists
    $x_1, \ldots, x_k$ in $G$ such that: \begin{align*}
        G / \ang{g} = \ang{x_1 + \ang{g}} \oplus \cdots \oplus
        \ang{x_k + \ang{g}}.
    \end{align*} The previous result implies that we can assume that 
    $|x_i| = |x_i + \ang{g}|$, so: \begin{align*}
        |G/\ang{g}| 
        &= |\ang{x_1 + \ang{g}}| \cdots |\ang{x_k + \ang{g}}| \\
        &= |x_1| \cdots |x_k|,
    \end{align*} which combined with Lagrange's theorem means that: \begin{align*}
        |G| &= [G : \ang{g}] \\
        &= |G / \ang{g}| \cdot |g| \\
        &= |x_1| \cdots |x_k| \cdot |g|.
    \end{align*} We want to show that $G = \ang{x_1} + \cdots + \ang{x_k} + \ang{g}$
    so for all $h$ in $G$, $h = ng + \sum_{i = 1}^k l_ix_i$ for some
    $l_1, \ldots, l_k, n$ in $\mb{N}_0$. By ($\ast$) we know that: \begin{align*}
        &h + \ang{g} = (l_1x_1 + \cdots + l_kx_k) + \ang{g} \\
        \Longrightarrow \qquad&
        h \in (l_1x_1 + \cdots + l_kx_k) + \ang{g} \\
        \Longrightarrow \qquad&
        h = l_1x_1 + \cdots + l_kx_k + ng \text{ for some } n.
    \end{align*} As we have that $G$ is a sum of $\ang{x_1}, \ldots, \ang{x_k},
    \ang{g}$ and its size is a product of the size of these groups, $G$
    is an inner direct product of said elements as required.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups}

Suppose $G$ is a finitely generated abelian group, there exists
non-negative integers $n$ and $k$, primes $p_1, \ldots, p_k$, and
natural numbers $n_1, \ldots, n_k$ such that: \begin{align*}
    G \cong \mb{Z}_{p_1^{m_1}} \oplus \cdots 
    \oplus \mb{Z}_{p_k^{m_k}} \oplus \mb{Z}^n
\end{align*}
