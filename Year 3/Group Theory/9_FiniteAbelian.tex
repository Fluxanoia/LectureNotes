\section{Finitely Generated Abelian Groups}

We will write $\mb{Z}^n = \{(m_1, \ldots, m_n) : m_1, \ldots, m_n \in \mb{Z}\}$
and $e_i = (0, \ldots, 1, \ldots, 0) \in \mb{Z}^n$ with $1$ in the 
$i^{\text{th}}$ entry. These are the standard generators for $\mb{Z}^n$.
\\[\baselineskip]
For some $n$ in $\mb{N}$, we write $\mb{Z}_n$ to be the integers
modulo $n$ which is a group under addition. Additionally, $n\mb{Z}$
is a subgroup of $\mb{Z}$ and $\mb{Z}_n \cong \mb{Z}/n\mb{Z}$.

\subsection{Classification of Cyclic Groups}

For a cyclic group $G$, if $|G| = n$ finite, we have that $G \cong \mb{Z}_n$.
Otherwise, $G \cong \mb{Z}$.

\begin{proof}
    We choose $x$ as a generator of $G$. We take $\varphi : \mb{Z} \to G$
    to be defined as $\varphi(m) = x^m$. We can see that $\varphi$ is a
    surjective homomorphism. If $|x| = \infty$ then $\Ker(\varphi) = \{0\}$,
    otherwise, $\Ker(\varphi) = |x|\mb{Z}$. By the homomorphism theorem:
    \begin{align*}
        G = \Ima(\varphi) \cong \mb{Z}/\Ker(\varphi).
    \end{align*} The result follows as $\mb{Z}/\Ker(\varphi) = \mb{Z}$
    if $|x| = \infty$ and $\mb{Z}_{|x|}$ otherwise.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups}

Suppose $G$ is a finitely generated abelian group, there exists
non-negative integers $n$ and $k$, primes $p_1, \ldots, p_k$, and
natural numbers $n_1, \ldots, n_k$ such that: \begin{align*}
    G \cong \mb{Z}_{p_1^{m_1}} \oplus \cdots 
    \oplus \mb{Z}_{p_k^{m_k}} \oplus \mb{Z}^n
\end{align*}
