\section{Homomorphisms}

For $G$, $H$ groups, a homomorphism $\varphi : G \to H$ is a map that 
for all $x$, $y$ in $G$ satisfies:
\begin{align*}
    \varphi(xy) = \varphi(x)\varphi(y).
\end{align*} The image and kernel are defined as expected: \begin{align*}
    \Ima(\varphi) &= \{\varphi(g) : g \in G\}, \\
    \Ker(\varphi) &= \{g \in G : \varphi(g) = e_H\}.
\end{align*}

\subsection{Properties of Homomorphisms}

For $G$, $H$ groups and $\varphi : G \to H$ a homomorphism, we have that:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\varphi(e_G) = e_H$,
    \item $\Ker(\varphi)$ is a subgroup of $G$,
    \item $\Ima(\varphi)$ is a subgroup of $H$,
    \item $\varphi$ is injective if and only if $\Ker(\varphi) = \{e_G\}$,
    \item $\varphi(x^{-1}) = \varphi(x)^{-1}$ for every $x$ in $G$,
    \item For $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ in $G$,
        $\varphi(x_1 \cdots x_n) = \varphi(x_1) \cdots \varphi(x_n)$.
\end{enumerate} These properties lead us to the following: \begin{itemize}
    \item For a finitely ordered element $g$ in $G$, $|\varphi(g)|$
        divides $|g|$ by (6),
    \item If $G$ is a $p$-group for $p$ in $\mb{P}$, the image of every
        homomorphism on $G$ is a $p$-group also.
\end{itemize} We can restrict homomorphisms to subgroups or compose them
and the result will be a homomorphism.

\subsection{Homomorphisms and Generating Sets}

For $G$, $H$ groups, a homomorphism $\varphi : G \to H$, and $X \subseteq G$,
we have that \linebreak $\varphi(\ang{X}) = \ang{\varphi(X)}$.

Furthermore, for another homomorphism $\psi : G \to H$ with $X$ being
a generating set for $G$, if $\varphi(x) = \psi(x)$ for each $x$ in $X$,
then $\varphi = \psi$.
