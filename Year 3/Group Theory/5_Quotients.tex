\section{Quotient Groups}

For a group $G$ with $H \nsub G$, $G / H$ is a group under
set multiplication and for every $a$, $b$ in $G$ satisfies:
\begin{align*}
    (aH)(bH) = (ab)H.
\end{align*} Furthermore, we have $\pi : G \to G/H$ the
mapping $g \mapsto gH$ is a surjective homomorphism with
kernel $H$.

\begin{proof}
    We know set multiplication is associative so, we take 
    $a$, $b$ in $G$, and see that: \begin{align*}
        (aH)(bH) &= aHbH \\
        &= (ab)(HH) \tag{$H$ is normal} \\
        &= (ab)H. \tag{$H$ is a subgroup} 
    \end{align*} Thus, $G / H$ is closed under the operation.
    We take the identity to be $e_GH$ and for $g$ in $G$,
    the inverse of $gH$ is $g^{-1}H$. So, $G/H$ is a group
    under set multiplication.
    \\[\baselineskip]
    $\pi$ is trivially surjective, for $g$ in $\Ker(\pi)$,
    $gH = H$ which means $g$ is in $H$. The converse is
    true as $H$ is a subgroup. Thus, $\pi$ is a homomorphism.
\end{proof} 
\noindent
The group $G / H$ with the operation of set
multiplication is called the quotient group of $G$ by $H$.
We call $\pi$ on this quotient group the quotient homomorphism
from $G$ to $G / H$.
