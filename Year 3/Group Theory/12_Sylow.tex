\subsection{Cauchy's Theorem}

For a finite group $G$ and a prime $p$ such that $p$ divides $|G|$,
$G$ contains an element of order $p$.

\begin{proof}
    We first prove the theorem for abelian groups, then for all groups.
    \\[\baselineskip]
    \textbf{Abelian Case} 
    Suppose $G$ is abelian.
    If $|G| = p$, then $G$ is cyclic with a generator of order $p$.
    So, we consider $|G| > p$ and proceed by induction on $|G|$. 
    We take $g$ in $G \setminus \{e\}$, if $p$ divides $|g|$, 
    we take $g^{\frac{|g|}{p}}$.
    Otherwise, by Lagrange's theorem, $|G| = |g| \cdot [G : \ang{g}]$
    so $p$ divides $[G : \ang{g}]$. Thus, $G / \ang{g}$ is an abelian
    group of order strictly less than $|G|$, so by induction, it
    contains an element of order $p$, $h\ang{g}$.
    We write $n = |h|$, we have that: \begin{align*}
        (h\ang{g})^n = h^n\ang{g} = e\ang{g} = \ang{g},
    \end{align*} so $p$ divides $n$. Thus, $h^{\frac{n}{p}}$ has order
    $p$ in $G$ as required. \qed

    \noindent
    We remove our supposition that $G$ is abelian.
    As before, if $|G| = p$, then $G$ is cyclic with a generator of 
    order $p$. So, we consider $|G| > p$ and proceed by induction on $|G|$.
    If $p$ divides $|Z(G)|$, as $Z(G)$ is abelian, we are done. Otherwise,
    we consider the class equation: \begin{align*}
        |G| = |Z(G)| + \sum_{C \in \mc{C}(G), \, |C| > 1} [G : C_G(g_C)].
    \end{align*} As $p$ divides $|G|$ but not $|Z(G)|$, there is some
    term of the summation that is not divisible by $p$. Thus, there exists
    $g$ in $G$ such that $g \in C$ where $C$ is a conjugacy class
    of size at least $2$ and $[G : C_G(g)]$ is not divisible by $p$.
    But, Lagrange's theorem implies that $|C_G(g)|$ is divisible
    by $p$ as: \begin{align*}
        |G| = |C_G(g)|[G : C_G(g)].
    \end{align*} Since $|C| \geq 2$, $g$ is not central in $G$, so
    $C_G(g) \neq G$. By induction, $C_G(g)$ contains an element of
    order $p$. Hence, $G$ does.
\end{proof}
