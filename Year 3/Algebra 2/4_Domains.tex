\subsection{Noetherian Rings (5.1)} \label{5.1}

A ring $R$ is Noetherian if every increasing chain of ideals in $R$
is finite.

\subsection{Finitely Generated Ideals (5.3)} \label{5.3}

For a ring $R$ with $I \subseteq R$ an ideal, $I$ is generated by
$i_1$, $\ldots$, $i_n$ in $I$ for some $n$ in $\mb{Z}_{>0}$ if:
\begin{align*}
    I = i_1R + \cdots + i_nR = (i_1, \ldots, i_n).
\end{align*}

\subsection{Finitely Generated Ideals in Noetherian Rings (5.4)} \label{5.4}

A ring is Noetherian if and only if every ideal of $R$ is finitely
generated.

\begin{proof}
    ($\Longrightarrow$) For an ideal $I \subseteq R$, we consider
    $i_1$ in $I$ and take $I_1 = (i_1)$. If $I_1 = I$ then we are
    done, otherwise we consider $i_2$ in $I \setminus I_1$ and
    take $I_2 = (i_1, i_2)$. Following this process, we get
    $I_1 \subset I_2 \subset \cdots \subset I_n$, for some $n$ in
    $\mb{Z}_{>0}$ as $R$ is Noetherian. Thus, we get a finite 
    generating set $(i_1, \ldots, i_n)$ for $I$.
    \bs
    ($\Longleftarrow$) If we have a chain of ideals
    $I_1 \subset I_2 \subset \cdots$, then 
    $I = \bigcup_{k \in \mb{Z}_{>0}} I_k$ is finitely generated
    by some $(i_1, \ldots, i_n)$ by assumption. For each $k$ in
    $[n]$, $i_k$ must be in $I_{m_k}$ for some $m_k$, so
    taking $m = \max(m_1, \ldots, m_n)$, $I_m = I$ as required.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Preservation of Noetherian Rings (5.5-6)} \label{5.5} \label{5.6}

All quotients of, products of, and polynomials with coefficients
in a Noetherian ring are Noetherian rings.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Quotients]
    For a Noetherian ring $R$ with $I$ an ideal of $R$, we consider
    $\varphi$ from $R$ to $R / I$ mapping $r \mapsto r + I$.
    By (\ref{3.15}), we have a bijection from ideals
    in $R$ containing $I$ and ideals of $R / I$ via $\varphi$
    which preserves the Noetherian property.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Divisibility (5.10-12)} \label{5.10} \label{5.11} \label{5.12}

For an integral domain $R$, we say that $b$ in $R$ divides $a$ in $R$
if there exists $c$ in $R$ such that $a = bc$. Thus, $a$ is in $(b)$
and similarly $(a) \subseteq (b)$. We note that such a $c$ is unique.
\bs
If $a$ and $b$ both divide each other ($(a) = (b)$, or $a = b\varepsilon$
for some unit $\varepsilon$ in $R$), we say they are associates.
For some $p \neq 0$ in $R$ where $p$ is not a unit, have that: \begin{align*}
    p \text{ irreducible} &\Longleftrightarrow 
    \bigl[p = ab \Longrightarrow a \in R^\times \text{ or } b \in R^\times
    \bigr], \\
    p \text{ prime} &\Longleftrightarrow 
    \bigl[p \, | \, ab \Longrightarrow p \, | \, a \text{ or } p \, | \, b
    \bigr]
    \Longleftrightarrow (p) \text{ is a non-zero prime ideal}.
\end{align*}

\subsection{Irreducible Primes (5.14)} \label{5.14}

For an integral domain $R$, primes of $R$ are irreducible.

\begin{proof}
    For a prime $p$ in $R$ with $b$ and $c$ in $R$ such that $p = bc$,
    so $b$ and $c$ both divide $p$. By the definition of primes, we have 
    that $p$ divides $bc$ so either $p$ divides $b$ or $p$ divides
    $c$. As such, if $p$ divides $b$ then $p$ and $b$ are associate
    so $c$ is a unit (and similarly for $p$ dividing $c$).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Factorisation (5.16)} \label{5.16}

For a Noetherian integral domain $R$, every $r \neq 0$ in $R$ can be factored as:
\begin{align*}
    r = \varepsilon q_1q_2 \cdots q_n,
\end{align*} for some unit $\varepsilon$ in $R$ and $q_1, \ldots, q_n$ irreducible in $R$
for some $n$ in $\mb{Z}_{\geq 0}$.

\begin{proof}
    If $r$ is a unit, then we are done with $\varepsilon = r$ and $n = 0$. If $r$ is
    not a unit, we first want to show that $r = q_1s$ for some irreducible $q_1$ and
    $s$ in $R$.
    \bs
    If $r$ is irreducible, we can take $q_1 = r$ and $s = 1$. If $r$ is not irreducible,
    then $r = b_1s_1$ for some non-units $b_1$ and $s_1$ in $R$. We continue, if $b_1$ 
    is irreducible we are done, otherwise, we write $b_1 = b_2s_2$ so $r = b_2s_1s_2$
    for non-units $b_2$ and $s_2$. Applying this process repeatedly, until we have
    $r = b_ns_1 \cdots s_n$ with $b_n$ irreducible. This process terminates
    as $b_{k + 1}$ divides $b_k$ for all $k$ in $[n - 1]$ and this implies that: \begin{align*}
        (r) \subset (b_1) \subset (b_2) \subset \cdots, \tag{$\ast$}
    \end{align*} which must terminate as $R$ is Noetherian.
    Using this fact, we can write $r = q_1r_1$ for some irreducible $q_1$ and $r_1$ in $R$.
    If $r_1$ is irreducible we are done, otherwise we apply the process repeatedly,
    yielding $r = q_1 \cdots q_nr_n$ which terminates by similar reasoning to $(\ast)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Unique Factorisation Domains (UFD) (5.17)} \label{5.17}

For an integral domain $R$, we say that $R$ is a UFD if every $r \neq 0$ in $R$ 
is a product of finitely many irreducible elements and a unit of $R$, unique up to
reordering and units.

\subsection{Confluence of Primality and Irreducibility (5.23)} \label{5.23}

For a UFD $R$, $p$ in $R$ is prime if and only if $p$ is irreducible.

\begin{proof}
    ($\Longrightarrow$) Proved in (\ref{5.14}).
    \bs
    ($\Longleftarrow$) We know that $p$ is non-zero and not a unit as it is irreducible.
    We suppose that $p$ divides some $ab$ for $a$ and $b$ in $R$, so $ab = pc$ for some
    $c$ in $R$. Using the properties of UFDs, we factor $a$, $b$, and $c$ into
    irreducibles which, by uniqueness, must contain $p$ (as $ab = pc$). Thus,
    $p$ divides $a$ or $b$ so $p$ is prime.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Highest Common Factor (5.24)} \label{5.24}

For a UFD $R$, with $a$ and $b$ non-zero in $R$, the highest common factor of $a$ and $b$
is the product of the common irreducibles in their unique factorisation (which is well-defined
up to units). Taking $h = \hcf(a, b)$: \begin{itemize}
    \item $h$ divides $a$ and $b$,
    \item $a = hx$ and $a = hy$ for some coprime $x$ and $y$ in $R$,
    \item $\hcf(ac, bc) = c \cdot \hcf(a, b)$ for any $c \neq 0$ in $R$,
    \item if $a$ and $b$ are coprime and $a$ divides $bc$ for some $c$ in $R$, then
        $a$ divides $c$.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coprimaility (5.25)} \label{5.25}

For a UFD $R$, with $a$ and $b$ non-zero in $R$, $a$ and $b$ are coprime if $\hcf(a, b)$
is a unit.

\subsection{Principle Ideal Domains (PID) (5.28)} \label{5.28}

For an integral domain $R$, we have that $R$ is a principle ideal domain if every ideal
of $R$ is principle (generated by a single element).

\subsection{Irreducibility, Primality, and Ideal Maximality in PIDs (5.31)} \label{5.31}

For a PID $R$, with $p$ non-zero and not a unit in $R$: \begin{align*}
    p \text{ irreducible} 
    \Longleftrightarrow p \text{ prime}
    \Longleftrightarrow (p) \text{ prime}
    \Longleftrightarrow (p) \text{ maximal}.
\end{align*}

\begin{proof}
    As $R$ is an integral domain we already have: \begin{align*}
        (p) \text{ maximal}
        \Longrightarrow (p) \text{ prime}
        \Longleftrightarrow p \text{ prime}
        \Longrightarrow p \text{ irreducible}.
    \end{align*} So, it is sufficient to show that: \begin{align*}
        p \text{ irreducible} \Longrightarrow (p) \text{ maximal}.
    \end{align*} We suppose $p$ is irreducible and $(p) \subseteq I \subseteq R$
    for some ideal $I$. As $R$ is a PID, we know that $I = (a)$ for some $a$ in
    $R$ so: \begin{align*}
        (p) \subseteq (a) 
        &\Longrightarrow a \text{ divides } p \\
        &\Longrightarrow p = ab \text{ for some } b \in R \\
        &\Longrightarrow a \in R^\times \text{ or } b \in R^\times \tag{$p$ irreducible} \\
        &\Longrightarrow I = R \text{ or } (p) = I,
    \end{align*} as required.
\end{proof}

\subsection{UFDs from PIDs (5.34)} \label{5.34}

Every PID is a UFD.

\begin{proof}
    For a PID $R$, we know that $R$ is Noetherian by (\ref{5.4}) 
    so every $a$ can be expressed as a product of irreducible elements 
    in $R$, say: \begin{align*}
        a = up_1\cdots p_n,
    \end{align*} for some unit $u$ and irreducible $p_1$, $\ldots$, $p_n$
    in $R$. We suppose there is another factorisation of $a$: \begin{align*}
        a = vq_1\cdots q_m,
    \end{align*} for some unit $v$ and irreducible $q_1$, $\ldots$, $q_m$
    in $R$. By (\ref{5.31}), we know that 
    $p_1$, $\ldots$, $p_n$, $q_1$, $\ldots$, $q_m$ are all prime
    (in particular, they are not units). Thus, if $n = 0$ then
    $u = a = v$, the factorisation is unique. If $n > 0$ then
    as $p_1$ divides $a$, it must divide $q_i$ for some $i$ in $[m]$.
    Since $q_i$ is irreducible, $p_1 = q_i$ up to units. Through
    cancellation ($R$ is an integral domain) and iteration, we see
    that these factorisations are identical up to reordering.
    So, $R$ is a UFD.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Euclid's Algorithm (5.36)} \label{5.36}

For a PID $R$ with $a$ and $b$ non-zero in $R$ and $c$ generating the ideal
$(a, b)$, we have that $c = \hcf(a, b)$ and $c = ax+by$ for some $x$ and
$y$ in $R$.

\begin{proof}
    As $c$ generates $(a, b)$, $c$ is in $(a, b)$ so $c = ax + by$ for
    some $x$ and $y$. As $(a) \subseteq (a, b)$, $(b) \subseteq (a, b)$
    and, $(c) = (a, b)$, $c$ divides both $a$ and $b$ so divides
    $\hcf(a, b)$ by definition. However, $\hcf(a, b)$ divides both $a$ and
    $b$ so must divide $ax + by = c$. As such, $c = u\cdot\hcf(a, b)$
    for some unit $u$ but since the highest common factor is defined
    up to units, we can say $c = \hcf(a, b)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Degree (5.39)} \label{5.39}

For a field $K$ and a polynomial $f$ in $K[x]$, we say that the largest
power of $x$ with a non-zero coefficient is the degree of $f$,
written as $\deg(f)$. We have that $\deg(0) = -\infty$ and
for some $g$ in $K[x]$: \begin{align*}
    \deg(fg) &= \deg(f) + \deg(g), \\
    \deg(f + g) &= \max(\deg(f), \deg(g)).
\end{align*}

\subsection{Division with Remainder (5.41)} \label{5.41}

For a field $K$ with $f$ and $g \neq 0$ in $K[x]$, there exists unique
$q$ and $r$ in $K[x]$ with $\deg(r) < \deg(g)$ and $f = qg + r$.

\begin{proof}
    For uniqueness, if $f = q_1g + r_1 = q_2g + r_2$ satisfying the
    conditions in the lemma then $(q_1 - q_2)g = r_1 - r_2$ but
    $(q_1 - q_2)g$ must have degree at least $\deg(g)$ unless $q_1 = q_2$
    and $r_1 - r_2$ has degree strictly less than $g$ by definition
    so $q_1 = q_2$ and $r_1 = r_2$.
    \bs
    For existence, if $f = a_nx^n + \cdots + a_0$ and 
    $g = b_mx^m + \cdots + b_0$ we suppose $m \leq n$
    as otherwise, we can take $q = 0$ and $r = f$.
    Then, we repeatedly map $f$ as follows: \begin{align*}
        f \mapsto f - \frac{a_n}{b_m}x^{n - m}g,
    \end{align*} until $\deg(f) < \deg(g)$, $r$ is this result from
    this iteration, and then $f - r$ is clearly a multiple of $g$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Polynomials over Fields (5.43)} \label{5.43}

For a field $K$, $K[x]$ is a PID.

\begin{proof}
    For an ideal $I$ of $K[x]$, if $I = \{0\}$ then it is principal. Otherwise, we choose
    $g$ in $I \setminus \{0\}$ of minimal degree. For any $f$ in $I$, we write
    $f = q \cdot g + r$ as in (\ref{5.41}) and see that $r = f - q \cdot g$ which
    is in $I$. Since $\deg(r) < \deg(g)$, it must be that $r = 0$ by the minimality
    of $g$ so $I = (g)$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Euclidean Domains (5.44, 5.47)} \label{5.44} \label{5.47}

For an integral domain $R$, $R$ is Euclidean if there is a map $\delta$ from
$R \setminus \{0\}$ to $\mb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ such that for all $a$ and $b$
in $R \setminus \{0\}$: \begin{itemize}
    \item there exists $q$ and $r$ such that $a = q \cdot b + r$ and either
        $r = 0$ or $\delta(r) < \delta(b)$,
    \item $\delta(a) < \delta(ab)$.
\end{itemize} Every Euclidean domain is a PID.

\begin{proof}
    Similar to that of (\ref{5.43}).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Ring Hierarchy}

For the ring definitions we have defined, we can say that: \begin{center}
    fields $\subseteq$ Euclidean domains $\subseteq$ PIDs $\subseteq$ UFDs $\subseteq$
    integral domains $\subseteq$ rings.
\end{center}
