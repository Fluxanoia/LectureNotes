\section{Field Extensions}

\subsection{Polynomials in Extended Fields (7.24)} \label{7.24}

For rings $R$ and $S$ with $R \subseteq S$ and $f$ in $R[x]$, we refer
to the image of $f$ in $S[x]$ as '$f$ over $S$'.

\subsection{Finite Fields and Integers Modulo Primes (8.2)} \label{8.2}

For a prime $p$ in $\mb{Z}$, we have that the finite field of
size $p$, denoted by $\mb{F}_p$, is $\mb{Z}/p\mb{Z}$.

\subsection{The Field of Rational Functions (8.3)} \label{8.3}

We define the field of rational functions over $R$ as the field of
fractions of $R[x]$.

\subsection{Subfields and Extensions (8.5, 8.19)} \label{8.5} \label{8.19}

For fields $K$ and $L$ with $K \subseteq L$, we say that $K$ is a
subfield of $L$ and $L$ is an extension of $K$, which may be
denoted by $L / K$.

\subsection{Conditions for Subfields (8.9)} \label{8.9}

For a field $K$ with $U \subseteq K$, $U$ is a subfield if and only if: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\{0, 1\} \subseteq U$,
    \item $U$ is closed under addition and additive inverses,
    \item $U$ is closed under multiplication and multiplicative inverses. 
\end{itemize}

\begin{proof}
    Follows from (\ref{1.14}).
\end{proof}

\subsection{Prime Subfields (8.11)} \label{8.11}

For a field $K$, $K$ either contains $\mb{F}_p$ for some unique prime $p$ in $\mb{Z}$
or $\mb{Q}$. This is the prime subfield of $K$.

\begin{proof}
    By (\ref{3.6}), there is a unique homomorphism from $\mb{Z}$ to $K$ so: \begin{align*}
        \mb{Z}/\Ker(\varphi) \cong \Ima(\varphi) \subseteq K.
    \end{align*} As $K$ is a field, $\Ima(\varphi)$ must be an integral domain so
    $\Ker(\varphi)$ is a prime ideal. As such, $\Ker(\varphi)$ is either $\{0\}$ or
    $\mb{F}_p$ for some prime $p$ in $\mb{Z}$. In the former case, $\mb{Z}$ is a
    subring of $K$ so its field of fractions $\mb{Q}$ is a subfield of $K$.
    In the latter case, $\mb{F}_p$ is a subfield of $K$. By the uniqueness of $\varphi$,
    such a subfield is unique.
\end{proof}

\subsection{The Field Characteristic (8.12)} \label{8.12}

We define the characteristic function on fields: \begin{align*}
    \Char(K) = \begin{cases}
        0 & \text{if } \mb{Q} \subseteq K \\
        p & \text{if } \mb{F}_p \subseteq K.
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

\subsection{Vector Spaces (8.15)} \label{8.15}

For fields $K$ and $L$ with $K \subseteq L$, $L$ is a vector space
over $K$.

\begin{proof}
    Follows from the field axioms.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Degree of Field Extensions (8.20)} \label{8.20}

For a field extension $L / K$, the degree of the extension is: \begin{align*}
    [L : K] = \Dim(L \text{ as a $K$-vector space}).
\end{align*}
