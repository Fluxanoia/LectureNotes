\section{The Basics of Computation}

\subsection{Decision Problems}

A decision problem is a problem which has a \texttt{Yes} or 
\texttt{No} answer.

\subsubsection{Decomposing Decision Problems}

A decision problem can be decomposed into two sets, the
\texttt{Yes} and \texttt{No} instances of the problem.

\subsection{Alphabets}

An alphabet is finite set whose members are called symbols (or
equivalently letters or characters).

\subsubsection{Strings}

A string (or equivalently word) over an alphabet $\Sigma$ is
a finite sequence of symbols from $\Sigma$. The sequence may be
empty, such sequences are denoted by $\epsilon$. The amount of 
symbols in a string $w$ is denoted by $|w|$.

\subsubsection{The Set of Strings}

The set of all strings over $\Sigma$ is denoted by $\Sigma^*$.

\subsubsection{Substrings and Concatenation}

For two strings $v, w$, $v$ is a substring of $w$ if it appears
consecutively in $w$.
\\[\baselineskip]
We write $vw$ to denotes $v$ concatenated with $w$ and for
$k$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, we say $v^k$ is the $k$-fold
concatenation of $v$ with itself ($k$ copies of $v$).
