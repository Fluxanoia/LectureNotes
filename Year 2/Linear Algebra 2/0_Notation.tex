\section{Notation}

We commonly deal with the following concepts in Linear Algebra 2
which I will abbreviate as follows for brevity:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | r | c | }
        \hline
        Term & Notation \\
        \hline \hline
        Additive identity of set $X$ & $0_X$ \\
        Multiplicative identity of a set $X$ & $1_X$ \\
        Set of linear maps from $V$ to $W$ & $\mathcal{L}(V, W)$ \\
        $\mathcal{L}(V, V)$ & $\End(V)$ \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
