\section{Data Modelling}

A model is a description of data, it should generalise, either as 
an abstraction or a simplification.We can quantify the performance 
of a model by how well it maps the data to the desired solution.

\subsection{Model Parameters}

Models are defined in terms of parameters which could be obtained
through trial and error or training data (through tuning or
training the model).

\subsubsection{Overfitting}

Training a model too hard on a specific data set can cause it
to 'overfit'. This means it performs very well on the trained
data set but does not generalise well.

\subsection{Deterministic Models}

Deterministic models produce an output without a measure of
confidence in that output.
