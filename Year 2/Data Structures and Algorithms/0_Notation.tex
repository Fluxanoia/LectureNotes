\section{Notation}

We commonly deal with the following concepts in 
Data Structures and Algorithms
which I will abbreviate as follows for brevity:
\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{ | r | c | }
        \hline
        Term & Notation \\
        \hline \hline
        The vertex set of a graph $G$ & $V(G)$ \\
        The edge set of a graph $G$ & $E(G)$ \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}
