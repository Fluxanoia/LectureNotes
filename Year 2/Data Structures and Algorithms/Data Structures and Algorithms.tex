\section{Graph Theory}

\subsection{Definition of a Graph}

A graph is a pair of sets $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is a set of 
vertices (or nodes) and $E$ is a set of edges (or arcs).

\subsection{Definition of an Edge}

An edge of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is $e = \{u, v\}$ in $E$ where $u$,
$v$ are vertices in $V$.

\subsection{Definition of a Neighbourhood}

For a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $v$ in $V$, the neighbourhood
of $v$ is the set $V' \subseteq V$ of vertices connected to
$v$ by an edge in $E$.
\\[\baselineskip]
The neighbourhood of $v$ is denoted by $N(v)$.
\\[\baselineskip]
The neighbourhood of a set of vertices is the union of
the neighbourhoods of each vertex.

\subsection{Definition of Degree}

For a graph $G = (V, E)$ with $v$ in $V$, the degree of $v$
is the size of its neighbourhood.
\\[\baselineskip]
The degree of $v$ is denoted by $d(v)$.

\subsection{The Handshake Lemma}

For a graph $G = (V, E)$, we have that: \begin{gather*}
  |E| = \frac{\sum_{v \in V} d(v)}{2}.
\end{gather*} \textit{This is because each edge visits two vertices,
so by counting the degree of each vertex we count each edge exactly
twice.}

\newpage

\subsection{$k$-regular Graphs}

For a graph $G = (V, E)$, we have that $G$ is $k$-regular for some
$k$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ if for all $v$ in $V$, we have: \begin{gather*}
  d(v) = k.
\end{gather*} We cannot have a $k$-regular graph where $k$ is odd
and $|V|$ is odd by the Handshake Lemma.

\subsection{Isomorphic Graphs}

Graphs $G_1 = (V_1, E_1)$ and $G_2 = (V_2, E_2)$ are called 
isomorphic if there exists a bijection $f : V_1 \to V_2$ such
that: \begin{gather*}
  \{u, v\} \in E_1 \Longleftrightarrow \{f(u), f(v)\} \in E_2.
\end{gather*} This relationship is denoted by $G_1 \cong G_2$.

\subsection{Definition of a Subgraph}

A graph $G' = (V', E')$ is a subgraph of $G = (V, E)$ if
$V' \subseteq V$ and $E' \subseteq E$.

\subsection{Definition of an Induced Subgraph}

An induced subgraph generated from $G = (V, E)$ by $V' \subseteq V$
is the graph $G' = (V', E')$ where: \begin{gather*} 
  E' = \{\{u, v\} \in E \text{ such that } u, v \in V'\}.
\end{gather*} \textit{Essentially, you generate an induced
subgraph from a subset of the vertices of a graph by selecting
edges that join vertices in the subset.}

\subsection{Walks}

\subsubsection{Definition of a walk}

A walk in a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a set of vertices in $V$ connected
by edges in $E$. The length of the walk is the number of edges
traversed in the walk.

\subsubsection{Definition of a path}

A path is a walk where no vertices are repeated.

\subsubsection{Definition of an Euler walk}

An Euler walk is a walk such that every edge is traversed exactly
once. Thus, for a graph $G = (V, E)$, the length is $|E|$.

\subsubsection{Conditions for an Euler walk}

For an Euler walk to be possible on a given graph,
all vertices must have an even degree \textbf{or} exactly
two vertices have odd degree. 
\\[\baselineskip]
If all vertices have even degree we 
have that the Euler walk is a cycle, if exactly two vertices have
odd degree then we have that these vertices are the start and end
points of our Euler walk. 

\subsection{Definition of a Connected Graph}

A connected graph is a graph where for each pair of vertices,
there is a path connecting them.

\subsection{Definition of a Component}

A component of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is a maximal connected 
induced subgraph of $G$. This means an induced subgraph of $G$
that is connected but is not longer connected if a vertex is
removed.
\\[\baselineskip]
Connected graphs have a single component, the entire graph.

\subsection{Digraphs}

\subsubsection{Definition of a digraph}

A digraph (or directed graph) is a graph where each of the edges
has a direction. This direction means the edge can only be traversed
in a single direction.

\subsubsection{The Directed Handshake Lemma}

For a digraph $G = (V, E)$, we have that: \begin{gather*}
  \sum_{v \in V} d^-(v) = \sum_{v \in V} d^+(v) = |E|.
\end{gather*} \textit{This is because if we consider the 'tail' of an
edge (the vertex it leaves), each edge has exactly one tail.}

\subsubsection{Definition of a strongly connected digraph}

A digraph $G = (V, E)$ is strongly connected if for each $u, v$
in $E$, there exists a path from $u$ to $v$ \textbf{and} 
from $v$ to $u$.

\subsubsection{Definition of a weakly connected digraph}

A digraph $G = (V, E)$ is weakly connected if for each $u, v$
in $E$, there exists a path from $u$ to $v$ \textbf{or} 
from $v$ to $u$.

\subsubsection{Definition of components of digraphs}

A strong component of a digraph is the maximal \textit{strongly}
connected induced subgraph.
\\[\baselineskip]
A weak component of a digraph is the maximal \textit{weakly}
connected induced subgraph.
\\[\baselineskip]
\textit{So, these are induced subgraphs that are strongly/weakly
connected but are no longer strongly/weakly connected once a
vertex is removed.}

\subsubsection{Definition of neighbourhoods in digraphs}

The neighbourhood of a vertex in a digraph can be considered by
looking at the edges \textit{from} the vertex and the edges
\textit{to} the vertex.
\\[\baselineskip]
The in-neighbourhood of a vertex $v$ are the edges that enter $v$.
The out-neighbourhood of a vertex $v$ are the edges that exit $v$.
These are denoted by $N^-(v)$ and $N^+(v)$ respectively.

\subsubsection{Definition of degrees in digraphs}

For a vertex $v$, the in-degree of the vertex $d^-(v)$ is the size of
the in-neighbourhood and the out-degree of the vertex $d^+(v)$
is the size of the out-neighbourhood.
\\[\baselineskip]
It can be seen that the degree of a given vertex is the sum of
its in and out degree (in a digraph).

\newpage

\subsubsection{Conditions for an Euler walk in a digraph}

For an Euler walk to be possible on a given digraph, we have
two cases, either:\begin{itemize}
  \item the digraph is strongly connected and every vertex
  has equal in and out degrees, or
  \item one vertex has an in-degree one greater than its out-degree,
  another has an out-degree one greater than its in-degree, and all
  remaining vertices have equal in and out degrees.
\end{itemize}
In the first case we have that the Euler walk is a cycle, 
in the second we have that the special vertices are the start and end
points of our Euler walk. 

\subsubsection{Cycles}

\subsubsection{Definition of a cycle}

A cycle is a walk where the first and last vertices are the same
and each vertex appears at most once (barring the first and last
vertex).

\subsubsection{Definition of a Hamiltonian cycle}

A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle where each vertex is visited.

\subsubsection{Conditions for a Hamiltonian cycle}

Whilst the conditions necessary for a Hamiltonian cycle in general
are unknown, by Dirac's theorem, we know that for a graph with
$n$ vertices, if every vertex has degree $\frac{n}{2}$ or greater
then a Hamiltonian cycle exists.

\subsection{Trees}

\subsubsection{Definition of a forest}

A forest is a graph with no cycles.

\subsubsection{Definition of a tree}

A tree is a connected forest (or a connected graph with no cycles).

\subsubsection{Path uniqueness of trees}

For a tree $T = (V, E)$, we have that for any $u, v$ in $V$, there
exists a unique path from $u$ to $v$.
\\[\baselineskip]
\textit{To prove this, suppose there are two unique paths between
$u$ and $v$. These paths must diverge and if we connect them, they
form a cycle which contradicts the definition of a tree.}

\subsubsection{The magnitude of edges in trees}

For a tree $T = (V, E)$, we have that $|E| = |V| - 1$.

\subsubsection{Rooted trees}

For a tree $T = (V, E)$, we can root $T$ with some $r$ in $V$.
For $v$ in $V\setminus{r}$, we define $P_v$ to be the path from 
$r$ to $v$, we then direct the edges from $r$ to $v$ for each $P_v$.
\\[\baselineskip]
For $u, v$ in $V\setminus\{r\}$, we say that: \begin{itemize}
  \item $u$ is an \textbf{ancestor} of $v$ if $u$ lies on $P_v$
  \item $u$ is the \textbf{parent} of $v$ if $u$ is in the
  in-neighbourhood of $v$
  \item $v$ is a \textbf{leaf} if it has degree $1$
  \item $L_0 = \{r\}$ and $L_n = \{v : |P_v| = n\}$ are the 
  \textbf{levels} of $T$
  \item The \textbf{depth} of a tree is the greatest $n$ where
  $L_n$ is non-empty.
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{Lower bound on the amount of leaves in a tree}

For a tree with $T = (V, E)$, if $V > 1$, there must be at least
$2$ leaves.

\subsubsection{Equivalent statements to the tree definition}

For a graph $T = (V, E)$, we have that the following are
equivalent: \begin{itemize}
  \item $T$ is a tree
  \item $T$ is connected and has no cycles
  \item $|E| = n - 1$ and T is connected
  \item $|E| = n - 1$ and T has no cycles
  \item T has a unique path between any two vertices
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Bipartitions}

\subsubsection{Definition of a bipartite graph}

For $G = (V, E)$, we have that $G$ is bipartite if there exists
$A \subset V$, $B \subset V$ such that $A$ and $B$ are disjoint
and the induced subgraphs of $A$ and $B$ have no edges. $A$
and $B$ are bipartitions of $G$.
\\[\baselineskip]
Saying $G$ is bipartite is equivalent to saying $G$ has no
cycles of odd length.
 
\subsubsection{Definition of a matching}

A matching in a graph is a set of disjoint edges.
\\[\baselineskip]
A matching is \textbf{perfect} if each vertex is contained in
some matching edge.

\subsubsection{Definition of an augmenting path}

Given a matching $M$ in a bipartite graph $G = (V, E)$, 
an augmenting path is a set of vertices in $V$ connected
by edges $e_i$ in $E$ such that: \begin{align*}
  e_i \text{ is } \begin{cases}
    \text{in } M & \text{for } i \text{ odd} \\
    \text{not in } M & \text{for } i \text{ even}. \\
  \end{cases}
\end{align*} With the condition that the first and last vertices
in the path are not in the matching.

\section{Types of Algorithms}

\subsection{Greedy Algorithms}

These types of algorithms start with a trivial solution and
iteratively optimise their solution based on the information
available at the time. They do not retroactively change the solution
based on new data, only add to it.
