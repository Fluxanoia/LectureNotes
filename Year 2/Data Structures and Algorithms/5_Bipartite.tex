\section{Bipartite Graphs}

A graph $G = (V, E)$ is bipartite if $V$ can be partitioned into
two vertex sets $V_1, V_2$ such that each edge connects a vertex
from $V_1$ to a vertex in $V_2$.

\subsection{Matchings}

For $G = (V, E)$ a bipartite graph with bipartition $X, Y$,
a matching from $X$ to $Y$ is a set of edges $M \subseteq E$
such that $f : X \to Y$ defined by: \begin{gather*}
  f(x) := y \qquad \text{ where } \{x, y\} \in M,
\end{gather*} is injective on $M$. The matching is called perfect
if $M = X$.

\subsection{Augmenting Paths}

An augmenting path is a path in a bipartite graph $G$ that alternates between
edges in a matching $M$ for $G$ and edges in $E(G) \setminus M$ with the first
and last vertices not being matched in the matching $M$. 

\subsection{Hall's Marriage Theorem}

For $G = (V, E)$ a bipartite graph with bipartition $X, Y$: \begin{gather*}
  G \text{ has a perfect matching from } X \text{ to } Y \\
  \Longleftrightarrow \\
  \text{For all } S \subseteq X, |N(S)| \geq |S|.
\end{gather*}
