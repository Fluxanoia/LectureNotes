\section{Linear Programming}

\subsection{Vector Comparison}

We have that for $v, w$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$ in $\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ such that: 
\begin{gather*}
  v = \begin{pmatrix}
    v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n
  \end{pmatrix} \qquad
  w = \begin{pmatrix}
    w_1 \\ w_2 \\ \vdots \\ w_n
  \end{pmatrix},
\end{gather*} we have that $v \leq w$ if and only if for all $i$ in $[n]$, $v_i \leq w_i$.

A result of this definition is that some vectors are incomparable.

\subsection{Standard Form}

The standard form of a linear programming problem is that we have an objective function
$f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$, an $m \times n$ matrix $A$, and an $m$-dimensional
vector $b$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$. The desired output is a vector $x$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that 
maximises $f(x)$ subject to $Ax \leq b$ and $x \geq 0$.
\\[\baselineskip]
We can put linear programming problems into standard form by doing the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Minimisation constraints have their signs flipped,
  \item Equality constraints are turned into two less than or equal to
  constraints,
  \item Greater than or equal to constraints have their signs flipped,
  \item Variables that could potentially be less than zero can be written
  as the subtraction of positive variables.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Simplex Algorithm}

The simplex algorithm takes a linear programming problem in standard form
and considers the feasible polytope formed by the constraints in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
It picks vertex on the polytope and moves greedily to the neighbour of
greater value until it cannot anymore. This does terminate with the optimal
solution and in practice only takes $\Theta(n)$ steps despite the large
number of vertices.

\subsection{Interior Point Algorithms}

Interior Point Algorithms are another type of linear programming
problem solving algorithm which have a polynomial worst case runtime.
However, in practice, they tend to be slower than the Simplex algorithm.

\subsection{Integer Linear Programming}

In a linear programming problem where we add the constraint that solutions must be
integers, we can relax our constraints to form approximate solutions.
