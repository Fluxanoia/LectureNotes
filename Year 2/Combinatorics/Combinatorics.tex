\section{Counting Techniques}

\subsection{The Bijection Rule}

For $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$, we define $[n] := \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$.
\\[\baselineskip]
For a given set $X$, if there exists a bijective function 
$f : [n] \to X$ for some $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$, $X$ has $n$ elements
(or rather $|X| = n$).
\\[\baselineskip]
This can also be achieved by listing out the elements of 
$X = \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\}$ as we can use $f : [n] \to X$
where $i$ maps to $x_i$.

\subsection{The Addition Rule}

We can count the amount of elements in a given set $X$ by
splitting $X$ into disjoint sets, counting them, and adding the
results.
\\[\baselineskip]
For $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$, and $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ pairwise disjoint
sets: \begin{gather*}
  \left|\bigcup_{i = 1}^n X_i\right| = \sum_{i = 1}^n |X_i|.
\end{gather*} \textit{For a set of sets $A$, pairwise disjoint means 
for two given sets in $A$, they are either disjoint or equal.}

\subsection{The Multiplication Rule}

If a counting problem can be split into a number of stages, we can
use the product of the number of choices at each stage to find
the total number of outcomes.
\\[\baselineskip]
\textit{For example, if we want to find how many three digit numbers 
there are, we can consider it as choosing three digits. We can choose
$1, 2, \ldots, 9$ for the first digit and $0, 1, \ldots, 9$ for 
the rest so we get $9 \cdot 10^2$ possibilities.}

\subsection{Inclusion-Exclusion Principle}

For $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$, and $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ sets: \begin{align*}
  \left|\bigcup_{i = 1}^n X_i\right| &= \sum_{i = 1}^n |X_i| \\
  &-\sum_{i_1 \neq i_2} |X_{i_1} \cap X_{i_2}| \\
  &+\sum_{i_1 \neq i_2 \neq i_3} |X_{i_1} \cap X_{i_2} \cap X{i_3}| \\
  &\ldots
\end{align*} \textit{Essentially, this says that the size of the
union of some finite number of sets is the sum of their sizes,
minus the sum of their \textbf{paired} intersections,
plus the sum of the intersections of \textbf{trios}, etc.}

\subsection{The Factorial}

For $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$ we can define the factorial $n!$: \begin{align*}
  n! = \begin{cases*}
    1 & n = 0 \\
    \prod_{i = 1}^n(i) & \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases*}
\end{align*} For $k$ in $\mathbb{N}$ we can further define $(n)_k$: \begin{gather*}
  (n)_k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!} = n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1).
\end{gather*} \textit{This can be though of as the factorial with $k$
elements (starting at $n$). So, $(n)_n = n!$, $(n)_1 = n$, etc.}

\newpage

\subsection{The Binomial Coefficient}

For $n, k$ in $\mathbb{N}$, we can define the binomial coefficient: \begin{gather*}
 {n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = \frac{(n)_k}{k!}.
\end{gather*} 
This is the number of ways of choosing $k$-element subsets
from an $n$-element set. Furthermore, we have: \begin{gather*}
  {n \choose k} = {n \choose n - k},
\end{gather*} as choosing $k$ elements is equivalent to choosing
$n - k$ elements to remove.
\\[\baselineskip]
There are some notes to be made on the definition: \begin{itemize}
  \item ${n \choose k} = 0$ if $k > n$
  \item ${n \choose 0} = {n \choose n} = 1$
  \item ${n \choose k} \geq 0$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Pascal's Identity}

Say we are selecting $k$ elements from an $n$-element set (unordered, 
without repeats). We will see that there are ${n \choose k}$ possibilities.
If we fix an element in the set, we can either include said element in
our selection or exclude it giving ${n - 1 \choose k - 1}$ and 
${n - 1 \choose k}$ possibilities respectively. Thus: \begin{gather*}
  {n \choose k} = {n - 1 \choose k - 1} + {n - 1 \choose k}.
\end{gather*}

\subsection{The Binomial Theorem}

By performing induction on Pascal's identity, we can see that for 
$a, b$ in $\mathbb{C}$ and $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$: \begin{gather*}
  (a + b)^n = \sum_{i = 0}^n {n \choose i}a^ib^{n - i}.
\end{gather*} Setting $a = b = 1$, we get $2^n = \sum_{i = 0}^n 
{n \choose i}$.

\subsection{The Pigeonhole Principle}

For $m, n, k$ in $\mathbb{N}$, if we have $k$ objects being 
distributed into $n$ boxes and $n > mk$ then one box must contain
at least $k + 1$ objects.

\section{Selection}

For this section, we will consider $n, k$ in $\mathbb{N}$.

\subsection{Ordered Selection with Repeats}

As we select, we have $n$ choices, and we select $k$ times. Thus,
by the Multiplication Rule, we get $n^k$ outcomes.

\subsection{Ordered Selection without Repeats}

As we select, the amount of choices we have decreases by one each time.
We start with $n$ choices and select $k$ times. Thus, by the Multiplication
Rule, we get \newline $n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1) = (n)_k$ outcomes.

\subsection{Unordered Selection with Repeats}

Let the set we are selecting from be $\{x_1, \ldots, x_n\}$. In this case, 
any solution can be aggregated into a list indicating how
many times the $i^{\text{th}}$ element was selected (for some $i$ in $[n]$).
For example, if we select $x_1$ three times and $x_2$ five times, 
the outcome would be of the form $\{3, 5, \ldots\}$.
\\[\baselineskip]
It can be seen that for each of these solutions, the sum of the elements in
the set must equal $k$. We can construct a solution by starting with a set
of all zeroes $\{0, 0, 0, \ldots\}$ and distributing $k$ into the set. For
example, for $n = 4$ and $k = 3$ the following are solutions: \begin{gather*}
  \{1, 1, 1, 0\} \text{ as } 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3 = k, \\
  \{0, 2, 0, 1\} \text{ as } 0 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 3 = k, \\
  \{3, 0, 0, 0\} \text{ as } 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3 = k.
\end{gather*} These solutions correspond to $\{x_1, x_2, x_3\}, 
\{x_2, x_2, x_4\}, \{x_1, x_1, x_1\}$ respectively.
\\[\baselineskip]
This distribution of $k$ can be thought of as seperating $k$ into $n$
groups. For example, the solution $\{1, 1, 0, 1\}$ corresponds to: \begin{gather*}
  \bullet | \bullet | | \bullet.
\end{gather*} An easy mistake to make is to assume that this means there are 
${k + 1 \choose n - 1}$ choices. But as you can see above, we need to be able to place
multiple dividers between two dots. So, for each placement, we need to add
two extra divider spots either side of our placed divider (however, for our
last divider we don't add two spots as there are no more selections to be made).
This means for each divider placed, the choices goes up by one overall (one
space used, two added) this leads to $(k + 1) + (n - 2) = (n + k - 1)$ choices.
Thus, we have: \begin{gather*}
  {n + k - 1 \choose n - 1}
\end{gather*} choices.

\subsection{Unordered Selection without Repeats}

This is identical to to the ordered case but we divide by the number
of permutations of the solutions as order does not matter. Thus, we get:
\begin{gather*}
  \frac{(n)_k}{k!} = {n \choose k}.
\end{gather*}
