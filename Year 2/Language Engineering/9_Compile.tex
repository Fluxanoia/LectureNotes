\section{Compiling}

Compiling is two-stage execution, the code is evaluated
into machine code - then it can be evaluated.

\subsection{Variables}

Variable's symbolic names are lost on compilation and 
replaced by indices refering to the distance to the variable
binding. In this case, our environment becomes a list of values
which we use our variable indices to index.
