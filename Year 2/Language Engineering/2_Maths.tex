\section{Mathematical Notation}

\subsection{Relations}

For two sets $X, Y$ we have that $f$ is a relation from $X$ to $Y$ if
$f \subseteq X \times Y$.

\subsection{Total Functions}

A total function from $X$ to $Y$ is a function $f : X \to Y$
that maps each value in $X$ to a value in $Y$. 

\subsection{Partial Functions}

A partial function from $X$ to $Y$ is a function 
$f : X \hookrightarrow Y$ where for some $X' \subseteq X$ we have
that $f : X' \to Y$ is total.
