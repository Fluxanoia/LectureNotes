\section{Syntax and Semantics}

\subsection{What is Syntax?}

Syntax is the grammatical structure of a program. For example,
for the program $x=y;y=z;z=x;$, syntactic analysis of this 
program would conclude that we have three statements concluded
with ';'. Each of said statements are variables followed by
the composite symbol '=' and another variable.

\subsection{What are Semantics?}

The semantics of a program are what the program evaluates
to or rather, the meaning of a syntactically correct program.
For example, $x=y$ evaluates to setting the value of $x$ to the 
value of $y$.
